Welcome to FreeGA, the free/open source PCI VGA adapter. The goal is to
eventually support enough of the VGA specification to allow OSs with GUIs to be
supported. Possibly even hardware 3D acceleration using OpenGL.

Currently only the Spartan II Starter Kit using the Xilinx Webpack, available
from Xilinx (http://www.xilinx.com/), is supported. FreeGA only supports
mirroring the primary VGA adapter at the moment in `PASSIVE' mode. This is set
in the `vga.v' Verilog source file. Only `PASSIVE' support at the moment due to
inconsistent synthesis causing the PCI timing to often synthesise incorrectly.
Also, the emulation of the VGA I/O port registers is incomplete.

This document covers synthesising the design, and uploading the `.bit' file to
the Spartan III Starter Kit development board.

Requirements:
 - Xilinx WebPack (available from http://www.xilinx.com/)
 - Spartan III Starter Kit (available for $100 US from Xilinx also)
 - Eagle Layout Editor for creating the PCI stub connector (available from
   http://www.cadsoft.de/)
 - 1x PCI stub connector PCB
 - 2x 16211 24-bit bus switches
 - 1x 4N04 diode
 - 1x  Ohm resistor
 - 2x 40-pin 90 degree edge connectors
 
Optional:
 - The GNU make utility for synthesising without using Xilinx ISE GUI
 - Python (plus wxWidgets for some of the scripts)
 - Image editor like the GIMP for editing fonts.
 - KDE's `kate' text editor, it is very good.
 - Icarus Verilog is useful for simulating FreeGA
 
Synthesising using GNU make:
 - Change to the `FreeGA/src' directory.
 - Type `make'.
 - Run `impact' from the Xilinx WebPack to upload the design
 
Using Xilinx ISE:
(unimplemented at the moment, just needs a project created and all the relevant
files added.)
